# Two Sum

**Level**: Easy  
**Topics**: Array, Hash Table

## Problem Description

You can find the problem statement on [https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/).

## Example 1

**Input**: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`  
**Output**: `[0, 1]`  
**Explanation**: Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.

## Example 2

**Input**: `nums = [3, 2, 4]`, `target = 6`  
**Output**: `[1, 2]`  

## Example 3

**Input**: `nums = [3, 3]`, `target = 6`  
**Output**: `[0, 1]`  


## Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  let indices = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    let diff = target - nums[i];
    if (indices[diff] !== undefined) {
      return [indices[diff], i];
    }
    indices[nums[i]] = i;
  }
}
```

## Explanation

The function `twoSum` uses an object `indices` to store the indices of the numbers encountered as we iterate through the `nums` array. This objects acts similarly to a hash table. For each number, we calculate the diffrence `diff` between the `target` and the current number. If `diff` is already in the object, it means we have found the two numbers that adds up to the `target`, and we return their indices. If not, we store the current number and its index in the object and continue to the next number.
