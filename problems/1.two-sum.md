# 1. Two Sum

## Problem Description:

You can find the problem statement on [https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/).

## Solution:

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  let indices = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    let diff = target - nums[i];
    if (indices[diff] !== undefined) {
      return [indices[diff], i];
    }
    indices[nums[i]] = i;
  }
}
```

## Code Explanation:

1. Function Signature and Parameters:   
    ```js
    /**
     * @param {number[]} nums
     * @param {number} target
     * @return {number[]}
     */
    function twoSum(nums, target) {
    ```
    - The function `twoSum` takes two parameters:
        - `nums`: an array of numbers.
        - `target`: a number representing the target sum.   

2. Initializing an Object to Store Indices:
    ```js
    let indices = {};
    ```
    - An empty object `indices` is initialized to keep track of the numbers in `nums` and their corresponding indices.  

3. Iterating Through the Array:
    ```js
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
      let diff = target - nums[i];
    ```
    - A `for` loop iterates over each element in the `nums` array.
    - For each element, `diff` is calculated as the diffrence between the target and the current element (`nums[i]`).  

4. Checking for Complement:
    ```js
    if (indices[diff] !== undefined) {
      return [indices[diff], i];
    }
    ```
    - The code checks if `diff` (the complement of the current element) exists in the `indices` object.
    - If `diff` exists, it means that the current element and the element at `indices[diff]` add up to the targt. The function then returns their indices as an array.   

5. Storing the Index of the Current Element:
    ```js
    indices[nums[i]] = i;
    ```
    - If `diff` is not found in `indices`, the current element and its index are stored in the `indices` object.


## Example Walkthrough:

Let's go through an example with specific inputs:

```js
let nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
let target = 9
```
- We call the function `twoSum(nums, target)`.  

Iteration 1: 
- `i = 0`
- `nums[i] = 2`
- `diff = target - nums[i] = 9 - 2 = 7`
- `indices` does not contain `7`, so store `2` with its index `0`:`indices = {2:0}`.  

Iteration 2:
- `i = 1`
- `num[i] = 7`
- `diff = target - nums[i] = 9 - 7 = 2`
- `indices` contains `2` (from the previous iteration), so return `[indices[2], 1]`, which is `[0, 1]`.
