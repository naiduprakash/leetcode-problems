# 0001. Two Sum

## Problem Description:

You can find the problem statement on [https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/).

## Solution:

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} target
 * @return {number[]}
 */
function twoSum(nums, target) {
  let indices = {};
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    let diff = target - nums[i];
    if (indices[diff] !== undefined) {
      return [indices[diff], i];
    }
    indices[nums[i]] = i;
  }
}
```


## Example Walkthrough:

Let's go through an example with specific inputs:

```js
let nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
let target = 9
```

Initial State:
- `indices` is intialize with empty object `{}` : `indices = {}`

Iteration 1: 
- `i = 0`
- `nums[i] = 2`
- `diff = target - nums[i] = 9 - 2 = 7`
- `indices` does not contain `7`, so store `2` with its index `0`:`indices = {2:0}`.  

Iteration 2:
- `i = 1`
- `num[i] = 7`
- `diff = target - nums[i] = 9 - 7 = 2`
- `indices` contains `2` (from the previous iteration), so return `[indices[2], 1]`, which is `[0, 1]`.
