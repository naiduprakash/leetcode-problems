# 0005. Longest Palindromic Substring

## Problem Description:

You can find the problem statement on [https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/).


## Solution:

```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
function longestPalindrome(s) {
    if (s === null || s.length < 1) return "";
    
    let start = 0;
    let end = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i); // for odd length palindromes
        const len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1); // for even length palindromes
        const maxLength = Math.max(len1, len2);
        
        if (maxLength > end - start) {
            start = i - Math.floor((maxLength - 1) / 2);
            end = i + Math.floor(maxLength / 2);
        }
    }
    
    return s.substring(start, end + 1);
};

function expandAroundCenter(s, left, right) {
    while (left >= 0 && right < s.length && s[left] === s[right]) {
        left--;
        right++;
    }
    return right - left - 1;
}
```

## Function Breakdown:

1. Initialization:
    - `start` and `end` are initialized to `0`. They will keep track of the starting and ending indices of the longest palindromic substring found so far.

2. Iterate through each character:
    - For each character in the string, consider it as the center of potential palindromes and check for both odd and even length palindromes.

## Example Walthrough:

Let's go through an example with below inputs:

Initial State

- Input string: "babad"

Iteration 1 (`i = 0`, `start = 0`, `end = 0`)

- Odd-length palindrome:
    - Call `expandAroundCenter(s, 0, 0)`:
        - `left = 0`, `right = 0`
        - Characters: `s[0]` and `s[0]` are both 'b'.
        - Expand: `left--` (now -1), `right++` (now 1)
        - Out of bounds, so `length = 1 - (-1) - 1 = 1`
- Even-length palindrome:
    - Call `expandAroundCenter(s, 0, 1)`:
        - `left = 0`, `right = 1`
        - Characters: `s[0]` and `s[1]` are 'b' and 'a', respectively. They don’t match.
        - `Length = 1 - 0 - 1 = 0`
- Update start and end:
    - Maximum length found = 1
    - `end - start = 0` which is less than 1
    - `start = 0 - Math.floor((1 - 1) / 2) = 0`
    - `end = 0 + Math.floor(1 / 2) = 0`
    - Longest palindrome so far: "b"

Iteration 2 (`i = 1`, `start = 0`, `end = 0`)

- Odd-length palindrome:
    - Call `expandAroundCenter(s, 1, 1)`:
        - `left = 1`, `right = 1`
        - Characters: `s[1]` and `s[1]` are both 'a'.
        - Expand: `left--` (now 0), `right++` (now 2)
        - Characters: `s[0]` and `s[2]` are both 'b'.
        - Expand: `left--` (now -1), `right++` (now 3)
        - Out of bounds, so `length = 3 - (-1) - 1 = 3`
- Even-length palindrome:
    - Call `expandAroundCenter(s, 1, 2)`:
        - `left = 1`, `right = 2`
        - Characters: `s[1]` and `s[2]` are 'a' and 'b', respectively. They don’t match.
        - `Length = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0`
- Update start and end:
    - Maximum length found = 3
    - `end - start = 0` which is less than 3
    - `start = 1 - Math.floor((3 - 1) / 2) = 0`
    - `end = 1 + Math.floor(3 / 2) = 2`
    - Longest palindrome so far: "bab"

Iteration 3 (`i = 2`, `start = 0`, `end = 2`)

- Odd-length palindrome:
    - Call `expandAroundCenter(s, 2, 2)`:
        - `left = 2`, `right = 2`
        - Characters: `s[2]` and `s[2]` are both 'b'.
        - Expand: `left--` (now 1), `right++` (now 3)
        - Characters: `s[1]` and `s[3]` are both 'a'.
        - Expand: `left--` (now 0), `right++` (now 4)
        - Characters: `s[0]` and `s[4]` are 'b' and 'd', respectively. They don’t match.
        - `Length = 4 - 0 - 1 = 3`
- Even-length palindrome:
    - Call `expandAroundCenter(s, 2, 3)`:
        - `left = 2`, `right = 3`
        - Characters: `s[2]` and `s[3]` are 'b' and 'a', respectively. They don’t match.
        - `Length = 3 - 2 - 1 = 0`
- Update start and end:
    - Maximum length found = 3
    - `end - start = 2 - 0 = 2` which is less than 3
    - `start = 2 - Math.floor((3 - 1) / 2) = 1`
    - `end = 2 + Math.floor(3 / 2) = 3`
    - Longest palindrome so far: "babad"

Iteration 4 (`i = 3`, `start = 1`, `end = 3`)

- Odd-length palindrome:
    - Call `expandAroundCenter(s, 3, 3)`:
        - `left = 3`, `right = 3`
        - Characters: `s[3]` and `s[3]` are both 'a'.
        - Expand: `left--` (now 2), `right++` (now 4)
        - Characters: `s[2]` and `s[4]`  are 'b' and 'd', respectively. They don’t match.
        - `Length = 4 - 2 - 1 = 1`
- Even-length palindrome:
    - Call `expandAroundCenter(s, 3, 4)`:
        - `left = 3`, `right = 4`
        - Characters: `s[3]` and `s[4]` are 'a' and 'b', respectively. They don’t match.
        - `Length = 4 - 3 - 1 = 0`
- Update start and end:
    - Maximum length found = 1
    - `end - start = 3 - 1 = 2` which is greater than 1, so no update needed.

Iteration 5 (`i = 4`, `start = 1`, `end = 3`)

- Odd-length palindrome:
    - Call `expandAroundCenter(s, 4, 4)`:
        - `left = 4`, `right = 4`
        - Characters: `s[4]` and `s[4]` are both 'b'.
        - Expand: `left--` (now 3), `right++` (now 5)
        - Out of bounds, so `length = 5 - 3 - 1 = 1`
- Even-length palindrome:
    - Call `expandAroundCenter(s, 4, 5)`:
        - `left = 4`, `right = 5`
        - Out of bounds, so `length = 5 - 4 - 1 = 0`
- Update start and end:
    - Maximum length found = 1
    - `end - start = 3 - 1 = 2` which is greater than 1, so no update needed.

  
Final Result (`start = 1`, `end = 3`):
  - `s.substring(start, end + 1) = s.substring(1, 4) = aba`
- The longest palindromic substring found is "aba", but note that the function can return "bab" as well since both are valid longest palindromes in this case.
